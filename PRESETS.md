# SpotifyBigPicture - Presets

Presets are the recommended way to customize the app. They're combinations of multiple settings (see below) that form a unique identity and purpose. There's no harm done in just switching between presets at any time, so feel free to experiment until you find your desired configuration!

Here we will preset the different available with some examples:

### Default Mode (Reset)

![Default Mode](https://i.imgur.com/bZfvmqF.png)

The default mode: a balanced design that aims to present as much information as possible about the current track (along with its artwork) without compromising on visual appeal. Clicking this behaves like a reset button for all settings

### Compact Mode

Similar to the default mode, but the artwork is on the right and a little smaller, opening up slightly more room for the main content

### XL-Artwork Mode

The artwork is stretched to its maximum possible size. Apart from that, only the current track, the track list, and the progress bar are displayed

### Track-List Mode

![Track-List Mode](https://i.imgur.com/gQ9vTje.png)

Disables the artwork and instead only dimly displays it in the background. Doing this opens up more room for the track list, which becomes centered. Also disables some lesser useful information

### Split-Panel Mode

![Split-Panel Mode](https://i.imgur.com/Tr0qq7u.png)

A combination of the default preset and Track-List Mode that puts the current track information on the left and the track list on the right. Disables the artwork and instead only dimly displays it in the background

### Big Current-Track Mode

![Big Current-Track Mode](https://i.imgur.com/B9dIFVk.png)

Only shows the current track's title, artist and release in an extra large manner. The track list is disabled, the artwork is moved to the background

### Minimalistic Mode

![Minimalistic Mode](https://i.imgur.com/gg2kPBT.png)

A minimalistic design preset only containing the most relevant information about the currently playing track. The background only displays a plain color. Inspired by the original Spotify fullscreen interface for Chromecast

### Artwork-Only Mode

![Artwork-Only Mode](https://i.imgur.com/yFOlNbz.png)

Just displays the artwork on a background, literally nothing else
